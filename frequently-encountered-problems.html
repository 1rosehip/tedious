            <li><a

                (<code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager14.msc</code> for windows)</li>
            <li>Ensure user is enabled: SQL Server Management Studio -> Security -> logins -> enable user (that matches
                the userName in the '<a href="getting-started.html">config</a>' object in Tedious)</li>

                    number of the server</a>

                the config object itself, and NOT the Authentication options.
