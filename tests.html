<h1>Running Tests</h1>

<p>To run the tests locally, you would need to have a ~/.tedious/test-connection.json file in your home directory</p>
<p>E.g., </p>
<p>
        {% highlight javascript %}
        {
            "config": {
                "server": "localhost",
                "authentication": {
                    "type": "default",
                    "options": {
                        "userName": "your_username",
                        "password": "your_password"
                    }
                },
                "options": {
                    "port": 1433,
                    "database": "master"
                }
            }
        }
      {% endhighlight %}
</p>

<p>
    Note: Two tests are known to fail locally under Data-Types test: <br>
        <dd>dateTime2DaylightSaving</dd>
        <dd>dateDaylightSaving</dd>  
</p>

<p>
        A fix is soon to come...  
</p>
